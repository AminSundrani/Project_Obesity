Human’s obsession with health is nothing new. One unhealthy trend is on the rise and has been increasing every year, just by itself it has had a significant economic impact on the United States Health care system <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/adult/causes.html"><sub>[1]<sub/><a/> which amounts to an estimated US$147 billion, in Australian dollars, that’s approximately 6.3 billion <a href="https://www.cheesecake.com.au/our-cakes/everyday-delights/pavlova-dressed">Pavlovas<a/> from the Cheesecake shop.

## Project Introduction
What classifies someone as Obese? It is when an individual with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of over 30.  <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/obesity/diagnosis/"><sub>[2]<sub/><a/> The issue is complex, resulting from a combination of causes and individual factors such as behavior and genetics. In this project, we have gathered data from various sources to identify the strength of the relationship between obesity and it’s contributing factors. Hence, we have chosen to research on fast food restaurants availability, public transport availability, physical activeness, and general public’s age group in the 50 states of United States of America.
  
## Scope
<ul>
<li>Dataset Time to be 2019</li>
<li>All analysis and data to contain data of all the 50 states in USA, not including Federal District (District of Columbia) and Territories (American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands) </li>
<li>Average of Walkable distance - Public transport (Get total for each state) </li>
<li>Fast food -Include all restaurants in Number of restaurants per state (Heat Map number of Restaurant vs Obesity) 
Top 5 Fast-food restaurants - McDonald's, Starbucks, Chick-fil-A, Taco Bell, Burger King <sub><a href="https://www.eatthis.com/most-popular-fast-food-chains/">Eatthis<a/></sub>
Count restaurants for each states, use the dot size as the heat map. </li>
<li>Age group - Children and Teens (Ages 2 - 19 years) Adults - 20 Over</li> 
<li>Physical activity facilities to focus on Gyms, Physical activeness (Meeting CDC requirements -Achieving at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity and engage in muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week) </li>
</ul>
  
## Research questions to answer:
1.	The more accessible the fast-food restaurant the higher the obesity rate?
2.	Which gender prefers fast food that leads to obesity?
3.	Does the walkable distance to public transport relates to obesity?
4.	How many are walking for their day-to-day need? (Location of supermarket, bus stops)
5.	The greater number of gyms in a state, the lower the obesity rate
6.	The higher rate of physical activeness, the lower the obesity rate
7.	What population groups are most at risk to not meet physical exercises?
8.	Younger generation that tends to prefer fast food would be more obese
9.	Older generation that are more immobile tend to be more obese
